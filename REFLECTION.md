# Reflection

Using AI agents accelerated generation of boilerplate, tests, and documentation. Key takeaways:
- Agents are excellent at producing initial drafts but require human validation for domain logic (units, regulatory rules).
- The hybrid approach (agent + tests + human review) produced highest productivity and correctness.
- Next time: integrate automated linting and CI checks that run unit tests after generation to catch unit-conversion bugs early.
