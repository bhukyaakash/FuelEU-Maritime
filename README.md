# FuelEU Compliance Platform (Prototype)

Minimal full-stack prototype implementing FuelEU Maritime compliance modules:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS (skeleton)
- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript + Express + Postgres (hexagonal structure)
- Core: Domain, Application (use-cases), Ports
- Adapters: HTTP inbound, Postgres outbound
- Docs: AGENT_WORKFLOW.md, REFLECTION.md, README.md

This repository is a scaffold and runnable in Google Colab / local dev with Node and Postgres.
See AGENT_WORKFLOW.md for details on how AI agents were used to speed development.
